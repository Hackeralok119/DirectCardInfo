# CardLook (Educational Tool)

This project is an educational tool that, when a script is run, displays simulated card information both in the terminal where the script is executed and potentially sends it to a bot (depending on your setup). This is intended for educational purposes to observe direct output of generated data.

## Overview

This tool allows you to:

1.  **Generate "Cards":** Run a script to generate simulated card details.
2.  **Direct Output:** View the generated (non-real) card details directly in your terminal (Termux, Kali, etc.).
3.  **Optional Bot Output:** Optionally send the same information to a connected bot for demonstration.

**Please Note:** This project is strictly for educational purposes to illustrate script output and data handling. The card details generated are not real and do not hold any monetary value. Do not use this tool for any activity involving real financial information.

## Features

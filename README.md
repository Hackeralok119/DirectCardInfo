# DirectCardInfo

# CardLook (Educational Tool)

This project is an educational tool that, when a script is run, displays simulated card information both in the terminal where the script is executed and potentially sends it to a bot (depending on your setup). This is intended for educational purposes to observe direct output of generated data.

## Overview

This tool allows you to:

1.  **Generate "Cards":** Run a script to generate simulated card details.
2.  **Direct Output:** View the generated (non-real) card details directly in your terminal (Termux, Kali, etc.).
3.  **Optional Bot Output:** Optionally send the same information to a connected bot for demonstration.

**Please Note:** This project is strictly for educational purposes to illustrate script output and data handling. The card details generated are not real and do not hold any monetary value. Do not use this tool for any activity involving real financial information.

## Features

* Direct display of simulated card data in the terminal.
* Illustrates immediate script output.
* Optional bot integration for data delivery demonstration.

## Installation and Running (Conceptual for Educational Use)

These are example commands you might use in a Linux-based environment like Termux or Kali. **Please be cautious when granting storage access.**

1.  **Grant Storage Access (Termux):**
    ```bash
    termux-setup-storage
    ```

2.  **Update and Upgrade System:**
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

3.  **Install Python (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3 -y
    ```

4.  **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DirectCardInfo
